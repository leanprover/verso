# Test Projects for Verso Development

This directory contains test projects that are used during the
development of Verso. Their build processes integrate with that of
Verso itself, and using them on a standalone basis requires
substantial changes.

Sarting points for projects can be found in the
[Verso templates repository](https://github.com/leanprover/verso-templates).
