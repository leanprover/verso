#doc (Manual) "Manuals and Books" =>
%%%
tag := "manual"
htmlSplit := .never
%%%

Verso's {name}`Manual` genre can be used to write reference manuals, textbooks, or other book-like documents.
It supports generating both HTML and PDFs via LaTeX, but the PDF support is relatively immature and untested compared to the HTML support.

{docstring Manual}

{docstring Manual.PartMetadata}

{docstring Manual.HtmlSplitMode}

The {name}`Manual` genre's block and inline element types are extensible.
In the document, they consist of instances of {name}`Manual.Block` and {name}`Manual.Inline`, respectively:

{docstring Manual.Block}

{docstring Manual.Inline}

The fields {name}`Block.name` and {name Manual.Inline.name}`Inline.name` are used to look up concrete implementations of traversal and output generation in run-time tables that contain descriptions:

{docstring Manual.BlockDescr}

{docstring Manual.InlineDescr}

Typically, the `inline_extension` and `block_extension` commands are used to simultaneously define an element and its descriptor, registering them for use by {name}`manualMain`.

# Tags and References
%%%
tag := "manual-tags"
%%%

The {name}`Manual` genre maintains a table of link targets for various namespaces, such as documented constants, documented syntax, technical terminology, and sections.
In this table, domain-specific names are mapped to their documentation location.
For items such as document sections that don't have a clear, unambiguous, globally-unique name, Verso requires such a name to be manually specified before it is in the table.
Extensions and parts for which names should be manually specified take a `tag` parameter.

:::paragraph
Specifying a tag has the following benefits:
 * The item is included in the quick-jump box and the index.
 * The tag can be used to construct permalinks that will continue to work even if the document is reorganized, so long as the tag is maintained.
 * The item can be linked to automatically from other documents.

Tags should be specified for all sections that the author considers to have a stable identity.

# Paragraphs
%%%
tag := "paragraph-directive"
%%%

The {name}`paragraph` directive indicates that a sequence of blocks form a logical paragraph.
Verso's markup language shares one key limitation with Markdown and HTML: bulleted lists and code blocks cannot be contained within paragraphs.
However, there's no _a priori_ reason to reject this, and many real documents include lists in paragraphs.
When using the {name}`paragraph` directive, HTML output wraps the contents in a suitable element that causes their internal margins to be a bit smaller, and TeX output omits the blank line that would signal a paragraph break to TeX.

# Docstrings
%%%
tag := "docstrings"
%%%

Docstrings can be included using the `docstring` directive. For instance,

```
{docstring List.forM}
```

results in

{docstring List.forM}

The {name}`docstring` command takes a positional parameter which is the documented name.
It also accepts the following optional named parameters:

: `allowMissing : Bool`

  If `true`, missing docstrings are a warning rather than an error.

: `hideFields : Bool`

  If `true`, fields or methods of structures or classes are not shown.

: `hideStructureConstructor : Bool`

  If `true`, constructors of structures or classes are not shown.

: `label : String`

  A label to show instead of the default.

::::paragraph
The {name}`tactic` directive and the {name}`optionDocs` command can be used to show documentation for tactics and compiler options, respectively.

```
:::tactic "induction"
:::
```

results in

:::tactic "induction"
:::

and

```
{optionDocs pp.deepTerms.threshold}
```

results in

{optionDocs pp.deepTerms.threshold}
::::


# Technical Terminology
%%%
shortTitle := "Glossary"
tag := "tech-terms"
%%%

The `deftech` role can be used to annotate the definition of a {tech}[technical term].
Elsewhere in the document, `tech` can be used to annotate a use site of a technical term.
A {deftech}_technical term_ is a term with a specific meaning that's used precisely, like this one.
References to technical terms are valid both before and after their definition sites.

{docstring deftech}

{docstring tech}


# Open-Source Licenses
%%%
tag := "oss-licenses"
%%%

To facilitate providing appropriate credit to the authors of open-source JavaScript, CSS, and HTML libraries used to render a Verso document, inline and block elements can specify the licenses of components that they include in their rendered output.
This is done using the {name}`BlockDescr.licenseInfo` and {name}`InlineDescr.licenseInfo` fields.
These contain a {name}`LicenseInfo`:

{docstring LicenseInfo}

The {name}`licenseInfo` command displays the licenses for all components that were included in the generated document:

{docstring licenseInfo}
