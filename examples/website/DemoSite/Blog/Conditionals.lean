Finally started blogging!
This post describes the syntax and semantics of conditional expressions in Lean.
Here are some examples:

```leanInit demo
-- This block initializes a Lean context
```


```lean demo
example := if true then 1 else 2
example := if True then 1 else 2
example : Int := if True then 1 else 2
```

```lean demo
/-- A recursive function -/
def slowId : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 0
  | n + 1 => slowId n + 1

#eval slowId 5

/-- An array literal -/
example := #[1, 2, 3]

example := 33
```

I can also prove things about conditionals!
```lean demo
theorem lt_4 (b : Bool) : (if b then 1 else 2) < 4 := by
  split
  . skip; decide
  . decide
```

It's also nice to write normal proofs sometimes.

```lean demo
def rev : List α → List α
  | [] => []
  | x :: xs => rev xs ++ [x]

def revAcc (acc : List α) : List α → List α
  | [] => acc
  | x :: xs => revAcc (x :: acc) xs

theorem rev_append_eq_revAcc (acc xs : List α) :
    rev xs ++ acc = revAcc acc xs := by
  induction xs generalizing acc with
  | nil => simp [rev, revAcc]
  | cons x xs ih =>
    unfold rev
    unfold revAcc
    rw [List.append_assoc]
    apply ih
```

Here are some uses of various constructors:
```lean demo
def squish (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | none => 0
  | some k => .succ k

def squish' (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | .none => 0
  | .some k => k.succ

open Nat in
def squish'' (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | none => 0
  | some k => succ k

```


Thank you for looking at my test/demo post.
