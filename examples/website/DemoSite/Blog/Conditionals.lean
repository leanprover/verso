Finally started blogging!
This post describes the syntax and semantics of conditional expressions in Lean.
Here are some examples:

```leanInit demo
-- This block initializes a Lean context
```


```lean demo (error := true) (name := fst)
example := if true then 1 else 2
example := if True then 1 else 2
example : Int := if True then 1 else 2
example : 2 < 5 := by
  constructor
  constructor
```

Here's the error:
```leanOutput fst
unsolved goals
case a.a
⊢ (Nat.succ 2).le 3
```

```lean demo
/-- A recursive function -/
def slowId : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 0
  | n + 1 => slowId n + 1

#eval slowId 5

/-- An array literal -/
example := #[1, 2, 3]

/-- An anonymous constructor -/
example : Fin 5 := ⟨2, by omega⟩

/-- An explicit constructor -/
example : Fin 5 := .mk 2 (by omega)

example := 33
```

I can also prove things about conditionals!
```lean demo
theorem lt_4 (b : Bool) : (if b then 1 else 2) < 4 := by
  split
  . skip; decide
  . decide
```

And hide proof states:
```lean demo (showProofStates := false)
theorem lt_4' (b : Bool) : (if b then 1 else 2) < 4 := by
  split
  . skip; decide
  . decide
```

It's also nice to write normal proofs sometimes.

```lean demo
def rev : List α → List α
  | [] => []
  | x :: xs => rev xs ++ [x]

def revAcc (acc : List α) : List α → List α
  | [] => acc
  | x :: xs => revAcc (x :: acc) xs

theorem rev_append_eq_revAcc (acc xs : List α) :
    rev xs ++ acc = revAcc acc xs := by
  induction xs generalizing acc with
  | nil => simp [rev, revAcc]
  | cons x xs ih =>
    unfold rev
    unfold revAcc
    rw [List.append_assoc]
    apply ih
```

Here are some uses of various constructors:
```lean demo
def squish (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | none => 0
  | some k => .succ k

def squish' (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | .none => 0
  | .some k => k.succ

open Nat in
def squish'' (n : Option Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | none => 0
  | some k => succ k

```

Here is a mutual block:
```lean demo
mutual
  def f : Nat → Nat
    | 0 => 1
    | n + 1 => g n

  def g : Nat → Nat
    | 0 => 0
    | n + 1 => f n
end
```

```lean demo
--- foo
example := 99
```

Here's an inductive type and a structure:
```lean demo
inductive A where
  | a1 | a2
  | a3 (n : Nat)
  | a4 : (n : Nat) → n = 3 → A

structure S where
  x : A
  y : String
```


Here is a proof with some lambdas and big terms in it, to check highlighting:
```lean demo
def grow : Nat → α → α
  | 0 | 1 => fun x => x
  | n + 2 =>
    let f1 := grow n
    let f2 := grow (n + 1)
    f1 f2

theorem grow_10_id {α} : grow (α := α) 6 = id := by
  repeat unfold grow
  sleep 10
  all_goals sorry

```


Here is a proof with big terms in the context:
```lean demo
section
open Lean

variable [Monad m] [MonadQuotation m] [MonadRef m]

def quoted (str : String) : m Syntax := do
  let s ← `(a b c #[x, $(quote str), z])
  pure s

example : ¬(quoted (m := m) = fun x => pure .missing) := by
  unfold quoted
  intro h
  let g : String → m Syntax := fun str => do
    let s ← `(a b c #[x, $(quote str), z])
    pure s
  have : g "hello" ≠ pure .missing := by skip; sorry
  sorry

end
```

It's possible to render a lot of info on one example:
```lean demo
open Lean Elab Term in
elab "%much_info(" t:term ")" : term => do
  for i in [0:20] do
    logInfoAt t m!"Hello! ({i})"
  logInfoAt t "Some multi-line\ninfo too"
  elabTerm t none

open Lean Elab Term in
elab "%more_info(" t:term ")" : term => do
  for i in [0:20] do
    logInfoAt t m!"Hello again! ({i})"
  logErrorAt t <|
    "And a great big error, " ++
    "much wider than the other info!"
  elabTerm t none
```

````lean demo error:=true
example := %much_info(22)

example := %more_info(25)
````

The info gets stacked up, with the greatest severity highlighting the range in question.

Here's some hoverable info:
```lean demo (error := true) (name := typeErr)
example : Nat := "Not a number"
```
```leanOutput typeErr
Type mismatch
  "Not a number"
has type
  String
but is expected to have type
  Nat
```


Here's some traces:
```lean demo (error := true) (name := traces)
set_option trace.compiler.ir.result true in
def f' (xs : List Nat) := xs.foldl (init := 0) (· + ·)

set_option diagnostics true in
example : (123123190283102938019238098 * 1234124).toString.length > 14 := by
  simp
```
```leanOutput traces
[diag] Diagnostics
  [reduction] unfolded reducible declarations (max: 34, num: 1):
    [reduction] outParam ↦ 34
  [type_class] used instances (max: 54, num: 1):
    [type_class] USize.instOfNat ↦ 54
  use `set_option diagnostics.threshold <num>` to control threshold for reporting counters
```

Here's a check:
```lean demo (name := check)
#check fun x => [x]
```
```leanOutput check
fun x => [x] : ?m.18581 → List ?m.18581
```

Thank you for looking at my test/demo post.
