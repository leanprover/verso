This is an example document. There's still bogus syntax highlighting
and no LSP features, but it does seem to run things.

There is *bold* and _emphasis_ available.

# Next steps

There are a number of basic things to fix:

 * No math or numbered lists yet
 * The parser is a bit of a kludge, with too much lookahead making up
   for lack of a clear structure
 * Custom roles/directives are not yet extensible with custom elaborators
 * Gratuitous line breaks a la GitHub-flavored Markdown in rendering

For demo-worthiness, we also need:

 * Fancier LSP support - at least highlight list elements and show the breadcrumbs
   * Some works now, but it's hacky
   * Only Emacs seems to show the bullet point highlights, so I need VS Code help
   * Still, it's *fun*!
 * At least one or two "global" document operations, like resolving cross-references
 * Embedded Lean examples with elaboration

As someone said:

> It's still a start! And we have `inline code`. And {vanish}[there can be secrets and] {rev}[documents *in* code].

Block code too
